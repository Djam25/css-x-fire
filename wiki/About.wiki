= About =

I am developing CSS-X-Fire in my spare time, which is possible thanks to my day-time job at [http://www.esn.me/ ESN]. My employer not only accepts but also encourages involvement in open-source projects. Head over to [http://pushingtheweb.com/open-source/ pushingtheweb.com] for a summary of open-source projects which my colleagues are involved in.
